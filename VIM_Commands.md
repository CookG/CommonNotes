`i` for the insert mode, and `ESC` back to the normal mode

`h` to the left, `j` goes down, `k` goes up and `l` goes right

`w` moves to the start of next word

`e` moves to the end of the word

`b` moves to the beginning of the word

number before above command works perfectly

`30i- ESC` will make an underline 30 times, `3igo ESC`will print gogogo for you

'f' to find next occurrence of a character, e.g. `fo`, 'F' to find previous occurrence of a character
