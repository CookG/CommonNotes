MY Project -*- mode: org -*-
#+STARTUP: showall
* Welcome to org-mode




  Welcome, and thanks for trying out Org-mode. Making outlines in
  org is very simple. It is just text! Just start typing.
* This is a headline, it starts with one or more stars
  A heading has one star, a sub-heading two, etc.
* Working with lists
** Moving around in our outline
** Moving around headlinesme, and thanks

* Install emacs, with org-mode and evil mode
** TODO Install emacs, windows/mac.
   For now, only org-mode editing will be in emacs, still work on 
   work flow to edit code in vim
** TODO Change themes and fonts.
** TODO Involve org-mode
** TODO Install evil-mode

* Short cuts for org-mode
   1. TAB to fold and unfold items, shift-tab to fold the whole document
   2. To move an item or a sub-list up/down just use M + up/down
   3. To promote or demote headings use M + left/right
   4. To add a new headline, press M + RET
* Working with notes/TODO
   1. Can add descriptions with :: This is a description
   2. You can make words *bold*, /italic/, _underlined_, =code= and 
      ~verbatim~, and, if you must, +strike through+.
   3. shift+left/right :: cycle workflow, can change TODO->DONE->empty.
   4. ctrl+c ctrl+v :: show todos in current document (*This is not work*)
   5. #+TODO: TODO IN-PROGRESS WAITING DONE :: this on the top line will active 
      more status for the todo list.
   6. Adding the workflow as 5 stated :: In the emacs-config file, after the
      line of (require 'org)
	(setq org-todo-keywords
	 '((sequence "TODO" "IN-PROGRESS" "WAITING" "DONE")))
   7. 

* DONE this and that
* TODO this and that
