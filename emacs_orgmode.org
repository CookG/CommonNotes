MY Project -*- mode: org -*-
#+STARTUP: showall
* Welcome to org-mode




  Welcome, and thanks for trying out Org-mode. Making outlines in
  org is very simple. It is just text! Just start typing.
* This is a headline, it starts with one or more stars
  A heading has one star, a sub-heading two, etc.
* Working with lists
** Moving around in our outline
** Moving around headlinesme, and thanks

* Install emacs, with org-mode and evil mode
** TODO Install emacs, windows/mac.
   For now, only org-mode editing will be in emacs, still work on 
   work flow to edit code in vim
   *Need to notice* :: Home directory on windows is c:/Users/xli/AppData/Roaming/.emacs or .emacs.d 
** TODO Change themes and fonts.
      https://github.com/sellout/emacs-color-theme-solarized
** TODO Involve org-mode
** TODO Install evil-mode

* Short cuts for org-mode
   1. TAB to fold and unfold items, shift-tab to fold the whole document
   2. To move an item or a sub-list up/down just use M + up/down
   3. To promote or demote headings use M + left/right
   4. To add a new headline, press M + RET
* Working with notes/TODO
   1. Can add descriptions with :: This is a description
   2. You can make words *bold*, /italic/, _underlined_, =code= and 
      ~verbatim~, and, if you must, +strike through+.
   3. shift+left/right :: cycle workflow, can change TODO->DONE->empty.
   4. ctrl+c ctrl+v :: show todos in current document (*This is not work*)
   5. #+TODO: TODO IN-PROGRESS WAITING DONE :: this on the top line will active 
      more status for the todo list.
   6. Adding the workflow as 5 stated :: In the emacs-config file, after the
      line of (require 'org)
	(setq org-todo-keywords
	 '((sequence "TODO" "IN-PROGRESS" "WAITING" "DONE")))
* Agendas
  1. New shortcuts:
     1. ctrl+c a :: agenda (*This is not work*)
     2. ctrl+c [ :: add document to the list of agenda files
     3. ctrl+c ] :: remove document from the list of agenda files
     4. ctrl+c . :: add date
     5. ctrl+u ctrl+c . :: add time and date
     6. ctrl+g :: stop doing what you are trying to da, escape
