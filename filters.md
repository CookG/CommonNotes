# The Butterworth Filter Design
Filter is used to shape the frequency spectrum of a signal in communication or control systems. The shape or width of the roll-off also called the "transition band", for a simple first order filter may be too wide, so active filters designed with more than one order are required.

The complexity or **Filter Type** is defined by the filters "order", and which is dependent upon the number of reactive components such as capacitors or inductors within its design.
